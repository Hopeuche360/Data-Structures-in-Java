# Data Structures in Java


The primary definition of a data structure is a mode of storing data that is efficient for insertion, deletion, and location of data. In today’s world, quick and efficient software is essential for users. Nobody can wait for a 14-minute buffer to watch a tutorial on Java.

Data Structures help in improving the response time of software. Hence Data Structures are of prime importance in software design and programming. Data Structures are essential for software development as quick and efficient software is of prime importance.

Hence Data Structures are an irreplaceable part of programming.

## Need for Data Structures in Java
- Speed of processing – Data is growing in size as we speak. Efficient Data Structures allow us to manipulate and retrieve data easily. Data Structures also help in reducing the response time of software.

- Retrieval of Data – The faster the data retrieval from a database, the better the application. Hence using the correct data structure to store data is important.

- Multiple requests – A single web server can get a million hits in a very short amount of time. Take the example of a website that posts the result of JEE. Hundreds of thousands of people all over the country log in and try to retrieve data from the database. In this case, without the proper implementation of a good data structure and efficient algorithms, the website is doomed to fail.
